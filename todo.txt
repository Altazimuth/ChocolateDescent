Large scale changes:
Integrate editor code.
    Will require cleaning up the UI code some, in particular getting portable directory iteration code working in file.cpp
Port to Linux. Known potential hangups so far:
    Usage of io.h functions. 
    Nonportable code in findfile.cpp. Make linux implementation, using dirent perhaps?
    Deal with MS's odd posix-y but not really functions, such as _getcwd. Implement a file of macros that defines them back to getcwd and so on on Windows?
    Desire to compile with both gcc and clang. 
        It would also be nice to get it working on macos, but this will require enslaving someone with a Mac I guess...
Port Descent 2.
    Some code can remain the same, but will have entirely separate game code.
        Texmap will probably also be separated, due to the considerable overhaul in it.
    Will probably require some funky work with the CMakeLists
    MVE decoder is required. Introduce libmve from D2X?

Small scale changes:
    User directory based configuration files. Currently assumes data is in working dir. Won't work on Windows if in program files, or Linux if in the proper locations, and so on...
